= Change Email

== Introduction

Changing email is done in 3 steps, the user's email will not be chaged until all 3 are completed:

1. link:#request_change_step_1[Request a change]
2. link:#confirm_change_step_2[Confirm the change from the old email address]
3. link:#verify_new_email_step_3[Verify the new email]

To find out what state of change the user's email is in you can use the user's new_email and is_new_email_confirmed attributes
as follows:

* If `new_email` is an empty string, the user is not trying to change their email.
* If `new_email` is non-empty and `is_new_email_confirmed` is false, the user has completed step 1 and needs to click the link in the email.
* If `new_email` is non-empty and `is_new_email_confirmed` is true, the user has completed step 2 and needs to click the link in the email.


== Request Change (Step 1)

**Authentication Required**

This begins the process of changing an email.  Once this step is completed a confirmation email will be sent
to the user's **old** email with a deep link to mobile app or fallback url. The fallback url is `<front_url>/change-email/<id>/<token>`.  The token will be used in the next step. Data available to mobile app when link is opened:

[cols="2,1,5"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description
|`user` | `int` | ID of user making email change request.
|`token` | `string` |
|`new_email` | `string` | New email user wants to change to.
|`$fallback_url` | `string` | Link to react app to handle request. Maybe link:https://dev.branch.io/getting-started/configuring-links/guide/#fallback-url-customization[platform specific]
|`type` | `string` | Type of request. Set to `change-email-confirm`.

== Confirm Change (Step 2)

**Authentication not required**

The second step is confirming that the user has control over the original email.  Once this step is completed
an email will be sent to the user's **new** email with a deep link to mobile app or fallback url.
The fallback url is `<front_url>/change-email-verify/<id>/<token>`.  The token
will be used in the last step.  After this `user.is_new_email_confirmed` will be `true`. Data available to mobile app when link is opened:

[cols="2,1,5"]

|Name |Type |Description
|`user` | `int` | ID of user making email change request.
|`token` | `string` |
