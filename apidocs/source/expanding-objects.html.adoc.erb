= Expanding Objects

Many objects contain the id of another object in their response properties.
Those objects can be expanded inline with the `expand` request parameter.  Objects
that can be expanded are noted in this documentation by an **expandable** marker.

You can nest expand requests with a dot. For example, requesting
`menu.items` on a restaurant will expand the menu property into a full menu
object, and will then expand the items property on that menu into a full items object.
You can expand multiple things at once by separating them with a comma.
